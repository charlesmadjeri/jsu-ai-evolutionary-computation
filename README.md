#  Traveling Salesman Problem Solver

Description:
This project provides an implementation of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), aiming to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. It's designed to demonstrate algorithmic strategies for solving combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on performance and clarity.
***
Features:

* Brute-force TSP solver (for small datasets)

* Greedy algorithm implementation

* Genetic algorithm (GA)-based solver

* Support for custom city coordinates and distance matrices

* Visual route plotting

* Performance comparison between algorithms
***
Installation & Usage:

1.Clone the repository

2.Install dependencies

3.Run the script with your preferred method or dataset

(Optional) Visualize the resulting path using built-in tools
***
Project Structure:

```main.py``` – Entry point for running the algorithms

```algorithms/``` – Contains different TSP solving methods

```data/``` – Sample datasets and coordinates

```utils/ ```– Helper functions for distance calculation, plotting, etc.

```results/``` – Output paths, plots, and performance logs

How It Works:
Users can choose between different solving strategies by passing arguments to the main script. The program calculates the total distance of the route and optionally plots the route between cities. The genetic algorithm includes configurable parameters like population size, mutation rate, and number of generations.
